    "  * We don't think in parallel\n",

    "  * The desire for parallelism often comes _after_ you've written your algorithm (and found it too slow!)\n",

    "  * Current computer archetectures push us towards parallel programming for peak performance â€” even if we're not on a cluster!\n",
    "  * But it's hard to design good parallel algorithms\n",
    "  * And it's hard to express and reason about those algorithms"
